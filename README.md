# Improved tree inference and transmission reconstruction from composite datatype representations of microbial genomes

`tree_inference` includes workflows that are involved in the composite datatype method. Those methods were applied to both the clinical and benchmark datasets. `Klebsiella`, `Pseudomonas`, and `outbreak_simulation` include the other relevant analysis also stated in the paper.
